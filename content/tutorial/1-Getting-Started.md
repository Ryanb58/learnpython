## Hello World

Most developers follow a tradition upon learning a new programming language.
This long lived tradition involves one writing code that outputs the text
"Hello, world!" to the screen in their shiny new language. Lets attempt the
same task here in python.

```
>>> print("Hello, world!")
Hello, world!
```

The text was outputted to the screen successfuly. Make note here that you
just told python to print out a sentence to the screen here.
