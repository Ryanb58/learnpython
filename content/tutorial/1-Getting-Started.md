## Getting Started

Lets pop into an interactive shell type the following:

```
4 * 7
```

You should see something similar to the following:

```
>>> 4 * 7
28
```

Awesome! You just did some multiplication and the product(result) was printed
out on the line below your input.

The astrisk is called an operator in python. Some other operators include:
`+`, `-`, and `/`.

Lets try them out:

```
>>> 4 + 7
11
>>> 4 - 7
-3
>>> 8 / 2
4.0
```

Neato! That seemed to of worked pretty well, but what about other operators?
Sadly this page would become cluttered if I were to include every operator on
it. Yet luckily for you there is documentation. The python docs are a fantastic
resource when you need to perform some sort of action but are unsure how. Lets
visit their documentation now:

[https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#mapping-operators-to-functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#mapping-operators-to-functions)

The link above is a direct link to the operators table that python includes.
So now for the challenge:

Take 4 to the power of 7. Your result should be: 16384

Answer:

```
>>> 4**7
16384
```
