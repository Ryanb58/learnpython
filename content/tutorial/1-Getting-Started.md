## Developer Tradition: Hello World

Upon embarking on the task of learning a new language a developer always starts
out by attempting to get the language to print the text "Hello, world!" on the
screen. This validates their development environment and machine as a whole are
setup properly. Lets attempt this task here in python.

```
>>> print("Hello, world!")
Hello, world!
```

As you can see the text was outputted to the screen successfuly. Make note here
that you just told python to print out a sentence to the screen.
