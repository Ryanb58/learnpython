## What is Python?

Python is a programming language that is easy to read, fun to use, and quick
for development. There is an infinite amount of things you can accomplish by
mixing and matching the modules in python. Think of this language as a way to connect things together in the digital world.

## Use Cases:

As I previously said, there is an infinite amount of tasks you can accomplish
by using python, yet here I shall list a few that people normally want to do
when first coming to python.

- Automate a repetitve task on the computer.

- Create a timer that triggers real actions such as turning ones  thermostat
down at night.

- Take data from a website and place it into a file for use on your desktop.

- Rename a lot of files or folders at once.

- Build an interactive website.

- Process a lot of data.


## How To Run The Code:

Most times you would install python locally, however, that takes some effort
that you may not want to go through initially. Below is the link to the offical
python website where you can download it if you want:

[python](https://python.org/)

For those of you who just want to get started, I recomend just visiting the URL
 below, as everything this tutorial covers is executable on this webpage.

[Python REPL](https://repl.it/languages/python3)

Once you open up the page above, you should see something along the following:

```
Python 3.6.x (default, Dec 2015, 13:05:11)
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux
>
```

This is called the python interpreter. The code from the tutorials can be typed
directly into this area. We will not be using the `main.py` file for a bit.

## Writing Your First Code:

Upon embarking on the task of learning a new language a developer always starts
out by attempting to get the language to print the text "Hello, world!" on the
screen. This is called the Hello World Test. Doing so validates their
development environment and desktop as a whole are setup properly. Lets attempt
this here in python.

```
>>> print("Hello, world!")
Hello, world!
```

`print` is a very useful function that is available in all version of python.

Take note of how we put the sentence inside of quotes. This is called a string
in most programming languages.
