## Welcome to learn python!

Hello world, my name is Taylor Brazelton. I am the author of this website. I
hope you find it to be useful on your journey to learning how to program using
python.

Often I run into people who say things such as "Wow you write computer code? I
wish I could do that". Normally I ask those people to clarify why they think
they can't; more often than not I get responses along the lines of people
not knowing where they would begin.

That is one of the many reasons I have created this site. To help guide people
on their jounry to learn python.

Currently things are more of a work in progress but I will continue to add
tutorials and helpful articles to this site as I aquire the time. In the mean
time check out the getting started section under the tutorials dropdown.
