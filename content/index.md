## Welcome to learn python!

My name is Taylor Brazelton, the author of this site. Often through out my
days on this earth, I run into people saying things like "Wow you write
computer code? I wish I could do that". In which I always think about how
crazy these people are to think that they can't. Often I ask those people
to clarify why they think they couldn't and more often than not I get responses
along the lines of people not knowing where they would begin.
